Description: The Northern Swedish Population Health Study is a 
    population study in which genetic and phenotypic data was collected
    in more than 1000 Swedes. 
    As that data is sensitive, it cannot be made public.
    This package mimicks the dataset as close as possible, yet with
    random/simulated values instead.
